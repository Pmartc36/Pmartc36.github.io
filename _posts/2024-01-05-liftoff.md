Welp, this is my blog.

To be honest, I've started writing on here completely on a whim. I suppose we can think of this blog as a New Years or "Start of Graduate School" resolution. Truth be told, I'm not good at keeping resolutions but I do believe they set out a starting vision for the year, as malleable as it is. So, here I am. Graduate school may end up shaping the rest of my life after all so I want to keep a close eye on all my goings after all.

I'll keep updates here mostly regarding any technical and academic progress: maybe research updates, short lessons on a topic, or longer term plans. Maybe I'll change it up with geography fact dumps or market analsys or BJJ lessons. The world (this blog) is my oyster I suppose. I'll also try to keep updates anywhere from every few days to a week. Stay tuned
