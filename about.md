Hi! I'm Prithvi Nathan. I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying mixed-signal integrated circuit design engineering. My primary interests are high-speed electrical links, optical I/O, and brain-computer interfaces. 

I plan on using this blog to post about circuit design, my reading lists, miscellaneous thoughts.
