I'm an first year MS-PhD student of Electrical Engineering Illinois studying analog IC design with a focus on transceivers for optical links. I also have a strong interest in silicon-photonics and electronic/photonic co-design. My advisor is Pavan Hanumolu. 
I've earned my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering as well. Over my undergraduate career, my interests have evolved from radiology to analog ICs for brain-computer interfaces to work on SERDES.

The predominant goal in my life is to work on making ubiqutious access to compute. At the moment, I believe the most practical direction for this is working on maximizing the bandwidth of optical links and reducing the latency of network switches.

I plan on occasionally posting some takes on the circuits/photonics/networking world in general on this site. 

Oh and I'm an avid fan of 4X strategy games, reading/drawing atlases and maps, and burritos.
