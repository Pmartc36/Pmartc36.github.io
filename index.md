## About Me:

I'm an first year MS-PhD student of Electrical Engineering at UIUC studying analog IC design with a focus on transceivers for optical links. I also have a strong interest in silicon-photonics and electronic/photonic co-design. My advisor is [Pavan Hanumolu](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/hanumolu).

I've earned my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering as well. Over my undergraduate career, my interests have evolved from [radiology](https://tmslab.martinos.org/team/) to [analog ICs for brain-computer interfaces](./uploads/Design_of_VCO_Based_Continuous_Time_Delta_Sigma_ADCs_For_Neural_Recording_Applications.pdf) to [SERDES](https://shanbhag.ece.illinois.edu/index.html).


## Interests:

I structure my life around the idea of making ubiqutious access to compute. At the moment, I believe the most practical direction for this is working on maximizing the bandwidth of optical links and reducing the latency of network switches.

Oh and I'm an avid fan of 4X strategy games, reading/drawing atlases and maps, and burritos.
